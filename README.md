<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Physical human-robot collaboration is increasingly required in many contexts (such as industrial and rehabilitation applications). The robot needs to interact with the human to perform the target task while relieving the user from the workload. To do that, the robot should be able to recognize the humanâ€™s intentions and guarantee the safe and adaptive behavior along the intended motion directions. These advanced robot-control strategies are particularly demanded in the industrial field, where the operator guides the robot manually to manipulate heavy parts (e.g., while teaching a specific task). With this aim, this repository contains the code to implement a Q-Learning-based Model Predictive Variable Impedance Control (Q-LMPVIC) to assist the operators in physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) tasks. A Cartesian impedance control loop is designed to implement a decoupled compliant robot dynamics. The impedance control parameters (i.e., setpoint and damping parameters) are then optimized online in order to maximize the performance of the pHRC. For this purpose, an ensemble of neural networks is designed to learn the modeling of the human-robot interaction dynamics while capturing the associated uncertainties. The derived modeling is then exploited by the MPC, enhanced with the stability guarantees by means of Lyapunov constraints. The MPC is solved by making use of a Q-Learning method that, in its online implementation, uses an actor-critic algorithm to approximate the exact solution. The Q-learning method provides an accurate and highly efficient solution (in terms of computational time and resources).


### Built With

* [libfranka](https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka)
* [franka_ros](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

The proposed approach has been validated using a Franka EMIKA panda robot as a test platform. Thus, it is required the installation of Franka Control Interface to run the proposed code. See the [Franka Control Interface (FCI) documentation][fci-docs] for more information.

### Installation

1. Create a Catkin workspace in a directory of your choice. Open terminal and navigate to src folder in your catkin workspace:
   ```sh
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src
   ```
2. Clone the repository using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Andrea8Testa/Laboratorio.git
   ```
The present repository contains two main folders. [franka_example_controllers][frankaexamplecontrollers] must be used to replace the homonymous folder in [franka_ros](https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros). [Updating stategies][updatingstrategies] instead, must be kept inside the package.

3. Build the package:
   ```sh
  cd ~/catkin_ws 
  catkin_make
   ```
